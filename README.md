## Download

The last uploaded binary is still [v0.16-hall](https://github.com/EliteSavior/vasthall/releases/tag/v0.16-hall). This branch is the 0.17 source; it needs a signed `assembleFoss` build before a new release asset exists.

Direct (v0.16): https://github.com/EliteSavior/vasthall/releases/download/v0.16-hall/VastHall-v0-foss.apk

```bash
adb uninstall com.elitesavior.vasthall
adb install VastHall-v0-foss.apk
```

Signing note: this binary-only drop does not contain the private debug key used through v0.15. Android therefore requires a clean install when replacing v0.15 or older.
